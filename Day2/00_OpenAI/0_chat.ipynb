       "The formation process of a black hole begins when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and can no longer support itself against its own gravity. The core of the star collapses under its immense gravitational force, causing it to shrink rapidly. As the core contracts, it becomes denser and hotter, eventually forming a singularity—a point of infinite density and gravitational force—at its center.\n",
       "\n",
       "The collapsing core releases a burst of energy in the form of a supernova explosion, which can outshine entire galaxies for a brief period of time. If the remaining mass of the core is above a certain threshold known as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, gravity overcomes all other forces, and a black hole is formed.\n",
