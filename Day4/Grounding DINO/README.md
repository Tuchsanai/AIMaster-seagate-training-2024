# Grounding DINO notebooks

Grounding DINO is a super cool model for text-based object detection. This means that, given an image and some text queries, the model is able to automatically detect the queries in the image without requiring manual labeled data.

It is similar to [OWL-ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/owlvit) and [OWLv2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/owlv2).

2 notebooks are included here, one that showcases inference with Grounding DINO and another one which combines Grounding DINO with [SAM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/sam) in order to generate masks based on text prompts.
